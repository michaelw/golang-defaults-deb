Description: Go programming language compiler, linker, compiled stdlib
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.
 .
 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library. It currently depends on gccgo on architectures that
 do not have a native toolchain ("gc compiler") port but this will change soon
 -- packages that want to build with whichever of gc or gccgo is available
 should depend on golang-any.

 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library or gccgo on architectures that do not have a native
 toolchain ("gc compiler") port. Because the gccgo and Go releases are not on
 the same schedule, it is not guaranteed that the version of the Go language
 provided by the version of gccgo that this package depends upon will match the
 version of this package.

 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go documentation. You
 can view the formatted documentation by installing the golang-golang-x-tools
 package, running "godoc --http=:6060", and then visiting

 that (most of) a full Go development environment is installed.

Recommends: golang-${golang:GOVER}-race-detector-runtime
Description: Runtime support for Go's race detector
 The runtime support for the race detector is included as a binary
 file in the go source distribution so this package exists to build it
 from source on trusted infrastructure.
 .
 Installing this package will make the -race flag to the go tool functional.
 .
 This is a dependency package that depends on the race detector runtime for the
 default version of Go.

 default version of Go.
